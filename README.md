## Oxword Fictionary

A fun phone app where people can make up definitions for words that don't exist.

### Installing Fictionary

There are three places you can download Fictionary from:
- On Android, follow the steps [on the wiki](https://github.com/BenTBCampbell/Software-Engineering/wiki/Installing-with-F-droid) to set up F-droid. This will automatically notify you when a new version of the app is released and give you the option to update.
- If you don't want to set up F-droid, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/BenTBCampbell/Software-Engineering/releases) to download the latest version of the app.
- Finally, if neither of these work for you, go to the [downloads page on the Wiki](https://github.com/BenTBCampbell/Software-Engineering/wiki/Downloads).

### Cloning Help
If you get the error **file name too long** while trying to clone or pull the projcet, run this command:
```
git config --system core.longpaths true
```
